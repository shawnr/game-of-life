Corona SDK-based Game of Life
============================

This repo contains a CoronaSDK-based experimental implementation of Conway's Game of Life rules in Lua on a 32x24 grid. This was done purely as a stretch exercise in a very short amount of time. Maybe it will see further tinkering, but likely it will not. Feel free to check it out if you're curious, but temper your expectations.

This project is based on the Corona SDK, so you will need to have the Corona SDK installed to compile and build the project for any given operating system or device.

How to View
-----------

* Clone this repository
* Sign up for an account and download the free Corona SDK software at http://coronalabs.com. 
* Open the Corona Simulator and select the repository directory you just cloned.

Within the Simulator you can switch hardware types and see how it would build on different devices and platforms.
